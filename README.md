### Hi! I am Martina and I am a multimedia artist.

I got my Bachelor in [New Media Technologies for the Arts](https://www.accademiavenezia.it/offerta-formativa/arti-visive-12.html) at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice and then completed a Master's degree in [Project managment](https://almed.unicatt.it/almed-master-progettare-cultura-arte-design-imprese-culturali) at the Università Cattolica and the Politecnico of Milan. 

During my studies, I did an internship within [Studio Azzuro](https://www.studioazzurro.com/), and then in 2022 I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Israeli artist [Yuval Avital](http://www.yuvalavital.com/), becoming part of his creative team.

My artistic practice focuses on creating interactive experiences for viewers. I am interested in the context in which we live and how digital technologies affect society and culture. I am now attending the [Interface Culture](https://kunstuni-linz.at/Master-Programme.1594+M52087573ab0.0.html) MA programme at the Kunstuniversität Linz, Austria.
